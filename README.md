# Bridging Generations: The Intersection of Digital Instruction and Tentative Questions

## Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation
__Digital Humanities 110 | Jacqueline "Jackie" Vo__

__Project Description__ 
*In regards to this specific assignement:*
> This spring quarter's focus in the user interface and design course is focusing on the senior age group. In the pre-class survey, we were asked to view websites that may be of use to the older generation and how the layout may or may not help them naviagate. Since COVID-19 has put many of us in quarantine, I decided to look into instructional websites. I will be examining wikiHow because of their virtually automatic appearance on the web; wikihow has created instructions for a variety of topics. They also appear near the top of many search results.

> By improving the UX design, the site would be able to better inform those seeking online instructions. With this adjusted, the projected result is that seniors will be able to reclaim that youthful feeling of being able to figure out problems and do various projects on their own. 

*In regards to the project as a whole:*
>   My project is meant to be exist at the intersection of digital instruction with traditional art. In other words, I am taking what we know as a technologically progressive generation and appealing to older age groups with something that they are more used toâ€”greeting cards. Through a series of assignemnts, I will relay the positive effects of technology and find ways to make information more accessible. Inclusive spaces will overlook people of all age groups and even their technological abilities.

> Since we are expected to eventually produce something physicial, I felt that cards right now have developed in more creative regards. With the UX design of this website adjusted, seniors would better be able to make more exciting greeting cards and use what they know (traditional mailing) to reach loved ones from a safe distance. In order to get to this point, websites need to undergo improvements to make the process as easy as possible.

__wikiHow: The Mobile App__
Basic Information: There is a wikiHow mobile app in the Apple Store for iPhone users. 

> *We are using an iPhone as an example because the mobile app should be similar across all devices and Apple is known for their minimalist yet personalization approach to handheld devices! It's easier for the target age group to grasp.*
