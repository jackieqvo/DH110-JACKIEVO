# Documentation: User Testing #

WikiHow is a database of how-to-guides that consist of step-by-step instructions. The guides and articles are written across a variety of topics; the user would be able to explore topics and learn how to do things through detailed instructions and even animated images. The site is typically found at the top of search resultsâ€”this only gives UX designers more of a reason to test it and make sure that users are getting the most out of the website. 

After the first assignment, the heuristic evaluations indicated some discomfort in the clutter of the page. The average user would most likely stray away from the initial page of clutter. I concluded that even though wikiHow felt more accessible than Dummies, the format of the articles could be tweaked. I found that the search bar did not have the usual predictive text. This usually helps users narrow down their search and find what they need in an efficient manner. Overall, I chose to work with wikiHow because of their tips and interactive tabs. By letting their users to connect to others that are able to help them, the site shows that the information from their guides can be further broken down. The positives outweigh the cons; with this in mind, I created a survey from my notes.

Given my concerns, I have conducted a usability test to evaluate wikiHow's interface and how accessible it is. The test is ultimately improve the website because open sources like these should always be user-centered. The test is projected to be able to derive results that are able to measure ease and frequency of use, website organization and consistency, website content, and user satisfaction. An outline of the survey is provided in the following section. The tasks will reinforce or reeavaluate the severity ratings from the previous assignment. The goal of this assignment is to understand the user's perspective in order to improve their usability experience. 

**Purpose of UT**: 


**The Process and Materials**:

Due to COVID-19 protocols, this pilot usability test will be conducted remotely. Both the participant and the moderator will participate from home and via a Zoom Conference Call. The participant will recieve a link to the survey and be asked to share their screen.The moderator will record the process throughout the survey and assist when needed. To provoke more stream of thought and to better understand the user's experience, the moderator will conversed casually to keep the user comfortable when thinking out loud.

The moderator must first introduce the usability test process to the participant. After the user's informed consent agreement, there will be a section for pre-survey questions, three usability tasks, a post-test questionnaire, a satisfaction survey, and finally demographic data. The tasks will help the user navigate the website in regards to a relevant topic. After the tasks, there participant will be given time to comment on their favorite and least favorite aspects of the website. To further measure the user's satisfaction, the user will be able to choose from a list of words that would best describe their reaction and experience with the website. The demographic information of the participant will not be recorded for privacy purposes.
