# Documentation: User Testing #

**Introduction**: 

WikiHow is a database of how-to-guides that consist of step-by-step instructions. The guides and articles are written across a variety of topics; the user would be able to explore topics and learn how to do things through detailed instructions and even animated images. The site is typically found at the top of search resultsâ€”this only gives UX designers more of a reason to test it and make sure that users are getting the most out of the website. 

After the first assignment, the heuristic evaluations indicated some discomfort in the clutter of the page. The average user would most likely stray away from the initial page of clutter. I concluded that even though wikiHow felt more accessible than Dummies, the format of the articles could be tweaked. I found that the search bar did not have the usual predictive text. This usually helps users narrow down their search and find what they need in an efficient manner. Overall, I chose to work with wikiHow because of their tips and interactive tabs. By letting their users to connect to others that are able to help them, the site shows that the information from their guides can be further broken down. The positives outweigh the cons; with this in mind, I created a survey from my notes.

Given my concerns, I have conducted a usability test to evaluate wikiHow's interface and how accessible it is. The test is ultimately improve the website because open sources like these should always be user-centered. The test is projected to be able to derive results that are able to measure ease and frequency of use, website organization and consistency, website content, and user satisfaction. An outline of the survey is provided in the following section. The tasks will reinforce or reevaluate the severity ratings from the previous assignment. The goal of this assignment is to understand the user's perspective in order to improve their usability experience. 

**Purpose of UT**: 

The purpose of a usability test is to evaluate a website's accessibility in regards to their format, content, and essentially, their interface as a whole. The usability tests are recorded as a form of data. Not only will the data help understand the site from a user's perspective, their approach and opinions on the website will be able to help improve the user's experience. 

**The Process and Materials**:

Due to COVID-19 protocols, this pilot usability test will be conducted remotely. Both the participant and the moderator will participate from home and via a Zoom Conference Call. The participant will receive a link to the survey and be asked to share their screen. The moderator will record the process throughout the survey and assist when needed. The content recorded is the user's reactions and their screen. To provoke more streams of thought and to better understand the user's experience, the moderator will converse casually to keep the user comfortable when thinking out loud.

The moderator must first introduce the usability test process to the participant. After the user's informed consent agreement, there will be a section for pre-survey questions, three usability tasks, a post-test questionnaire, a satisfaction survey, and finally demographic data. The tasks will help the user navigate the website in regards to a relevant topic. After the tasks, there participant will be given time to comment on their favorite and least favorite aspects of the website. To further measure the user's satisfaction, the user will be able to choose from a list of words that would best describe their reaction and experience with the website. The demographic information of the participant will not be recorded for privacy purposes.

# Reflection: Ways to Improve #
**Summary of Findings**:

> Overall, the pilot test went smoothly. I predicted some issues and had the user experience and commented on my concerns about the website. I learned that the clutter of the wikiHow home page may intimidate users from using the website. In addition to this, even though the lack of predictive text was not an issue for my participant, they found the articles itself to be convoluted. The testing environment has increments of silence due to confusion; there was dissatisfaction expressed about the articles' formats. A concern I had was that the user would not be able to figure out the tasks because of how the site's redundancy with colors and form made important links and buttons blend in. I found ways to give the user hints so that they can finish the tasks. I found that conversations with the user will not only help them complete the tasks but there can also be a discussion of what they hope to see change. 

In future tests, I hope to be able to further connect with the participant and have them complete more tasks. This pilot test ultimately showed me that users are most likely able to figure out a website. The point of usablitity tests is for both efficiency and accessibility. This generally speaking, would improve the user's experience and this would then help them feel more inclined to use the website again.
