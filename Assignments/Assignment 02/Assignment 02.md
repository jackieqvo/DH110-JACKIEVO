# Introduction: User Testing #

The purpose of usability tests are to evaluate a website's interface and how accessible it is. These tests are meant to ultimately improve the website because open sources like these should always be user-centered. In this project, wikiHow is the website that will be evaluated. 

WikiHow is a database of how-to-guides that consist of step-by-step instructions. These often consist of still and even animated images. The site is typically found at the top of search resultsâ€”this only gives UX designers more of a reason to test it and make sure that users are getting the most out of the website. 

From my heuristic review, I noted that there was some clutter and difficulty searching for some items. The article itself is easier to find but items like tips, materials, and warnings are located at the bottom when it should be at the beginning or at least more prominent in the guide.
