# Bridging Generations: The Intersection of Digital Instruction and Tentative Questions

> *The objective of this assignment is to begin detaching myself towards the website(s) I have been analyzing to understand things from the user's perspective. It is important to gain new insight and things that I have not thought of.*
 
## Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry ##
__Digital Humanities 110 | Jacqueline "Jackie" Vo__

# Users in Context #

**Project Description (Revisted)**: 

> This project is still focused on digital instruction. To reiterate the project description from previous assignments, I was previously looking to take what we know as a technologically progressive generation to appeal to older age groups with something that they are familiar with. I studied websites with how-to guides to remind others of the positive effects of technology. Since I was not able to conduct my usability test with someone from an older age group, I asked one of my peers to be a participant. 

> Since then, I realized even though my generation is seen to be technolgically progressive, there are still many people who are not as tech-savvy. **People have different inclinations and so, by helping websites and information more accessible, I will then better be able to create inclusive spaces that will overlook people of all age groups and technological abilities.**
