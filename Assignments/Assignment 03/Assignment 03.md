# Bridging Generations: The Intersection of Digital Instruction and Tentative Questions

> *The objective of this assignment is to begin detaching myself towards the website(s) I have been analyzing to understand things from the user's perspective. It is important to gain new insight and things that I have not thought of.*

# Users in Context #

**Project Description (Revisted)**: 

> This project is still focused on digital instruction. To reiterate the project description from previous assignments, I was previously looking to take what we know as a technologically progressive generation to appeal to older age groups with something that they are familiar with. I studied websites with how-to guides to remind others of the positive effects of technology. Since I was not able to conduct my usability test with someone from an older age group, I asked one of my peers to be a participant. 

> Since then, I realized even though my generation is seen to be technolgically progressive, there are still many people who are not as tech-savvy. **People have different inclinations and so, by helping websites and information more accessible, I will then better be able to create inclusive spaces that will overlook people of all age groups and technological abilities.**

## **Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge** ##
**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**

> This project is aimed to support users in being able to navigate across a website containing how-to guides (ex. wikiHow, For Dummies, etc.) Since these websites are usually at the top of search results for how-to questions, it is important to promote and ensure accessibility as people attempt to get their questions answered. 

> This project will support users in making a card and/or other arts and craft projects.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**

> Depending on the subject of the guide that the user searches up, different basic needs can be fulfilled. For arts and crafts, the psychological needs are fulfilled. Their self esteem needs are to be fulfilled because of their ability to create a piece of art. They will be able to follow instructions and work their creative muscle.

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

> Before how-to websites accumulated professionals and contributors to make articles and guides, people would have to learn about projects and skills mostly through their peers. Users might pay for guided instruction to learn new things. Generally, information would be passed through word of mouth or written by hand. If users were looking for convenient ways to do something, it would mostly be through trial and error or even recall. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

> Limitations in learning new skills and projects would be the high time and material costs of lessons. The classroom is an excellent way to learn but there are plenty of projects that do not require an entire learning course. There are creative tasks like card making that just needs a few quick instructions. With technology, users may gain inspiration from a digital search and they will be able to pull up the list of required materials and instructions at almost any time. It makes it easier for users to remember and follow along.
> When learning and recalling a project, users may stick to one method. With the various styles in the different how-guides, users will be able to choose what kind of craft project (in this case, a card) they are looking for. 
## **Step 2: Target Users** ##

> **Demographics:** Anyone interested in learning about new skills and projects. People who are more inclined to learn on their own.
> 
> **Preferences:** Users who have the desire to learn and are looking for convenient resources to do so.
> 
> **Expertise:** Users do not need any particular level of expertise for this project.

> The context of use for this project is that users will be able to learn how to make a greeting card. To complete this activity, users will able to follow a set of instructions and a list of materials.

## **Step 3: Pick Research Method(s)** ##

> This project follows observation methods by employing participatory observation. With this, there were activities and questions that the participant explores. This is to get a genuine reaction and opinion to the websites. The interview will most likely be a conversation to promote and uphold the goal of candid reactions to betert understand from the user's perspective.
> 
> This interview was conducted over Zoom Conference Call to follow COVID-19 protocols. This is reasonable because in terms of accessibility and relevance, if a user were to need to look up a how-to guide, it should be on hand and thus, convenient. 
> The user is asked to share their screen while I recorded the task. 

> *I used a different participant from my usability test for consistency. Some peers are not as technologically inclined so I want to help make helpful websites as easy to access and understand as possible. My participant this time is more technologically inclined so I got to understand the perspective of someone who had a lot of feedback to give.*

## **Notable Moments From The Interview:**

**The Power of Visual Instruction**
> *00:06:44* - "I'm not much of a reader. So whichever website that includes like pictures or video that helps me a lot to see cause I like doing things and learning stuff hands-on and being in person. Whereas reading can get a bit difficult and you can see there's a lot of misunderstanding when it tells you to do certain stuff and you do it wrong."

**Preference for Conciseness**
> *00:14:19* - "There's only like six steps. Very easy to follow. It's not like it's like 20 pages 30 steps on how to make is like super simplistic and based off of that. You can even start up with this and then later you can add your own designs to it."

**Power to the User and Their Control**
> *00:32:50* - "I think the efficiency of how accessible these are does help a lot but I do like the mystery and the opportunity of what can happen and spontaneity of what may happen. So that's why I didn't put like a full 10. I want that freedom to maybe to figure something out of my own too."

> *By "these," Kaela is referencing to the importancing of having access to the guides and answers in a timely manner.*

## Reflection ##
The contextual inquiry process is an important component of my understanding of UX design. While the usability test showed me how someone might have navigated a few tasks, I had to remember that those tasks might not have been something that they knew how to use. With this contextual inquiry, there was more freedom to make observations and learn from my user. The usability test formal and since this process felt more conversational, I felt like this user had much more to say. It was also interesting to see Kaela move from topic to topic. This includes when I gave her give minutes to navigate the web at her own will. She ended up finding resources on how to make cards if someone did not have the materials at home. I did not even think of this. Kaela's openness to learning and exploring because she already is accustomed to tech helped me look for problems of websites that go beyond someone's ability to use their device. I got to focus better on the websites and her perspective as a user. Of course this is only one user persona. I appreciated her willingness to have a conversation as well. She made great comments and was honest in her stream of consciousness.

I think next time, I might offer more guidance so that I can gain more insight on different tasks. However, because I chose to let the user handle the search however they preferred, I got to genuinely watch the user perspective in play. Users don't follow a formular when searching for certain guides. This specific user persona looked for efficiency and conciseness but was also open to results that were not even intended in her online search.

I felt that aside from the lack of specific activities, the interview went well. I got a candid user perspective and also got to explore my values and wonders as a UX designer. I even went off script a few times to try to keep the interview's intended conversational tone. I really believe that this helped bring out honesty and the user's thought process. Overall, while I did look at the sample script, I tried to make my own so that it would be more relevant to my project's topic. The lesson learned from this assignment is that while users come with difference skillsets and preferences, something that they all have in common is their expectancy for efficiency and conciseness. People want to search and find things in a timely manner.

I hope that one day I get to be able to participate as the user and be interviewed. Having that experience would reinforce my understanding of the user perspective.
