# Bridging Generations: The Intersection of Digital Instruction and Tentative Questions

> *The objective of this assignment is to begin detaching myself towards the website(s) I have been analyzing to understand things from the user's perspective. It is important to gain new insight and things that I have not thought of.*
 
## Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry ##

# Users in Context #

**Project Description (Revisted)**: 

> This project is still focused on digital instruction. To reiterate the project description from previous assignments, I was previously looking to take what we know as a technologically progressive generation to appeal to older age groups with something that they are familiar with. I studied websites with how-to guides to remind others of the positive effects of technology. Since I was not able to conduct my usability test with someone from an older age group, I asked one of my peers to be a participant. 

> Since then, I realized even though my generation is seen to be technolgically progressive, there are still many people who are not as tech-savvy. **People have different inclinations and so, by helping websites and information more accessible, I will then better be able to create inclusive spaces that will overlook people of all age groups and technological abilities.**

## **Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge** ##
**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**

> This project is aimed to support users in being able to navigate across a website containing how-to guides (ex. wikiHow, For Dummies, etc.) Since these websites are usually at the top of search results for how-to questions, it is important to promote and ensure accessibility as people attempt to get their questions answered. 

> This project will support users in making a card and/or other arts and craft projects.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**

> Depending on the subject of the guide that the user searches up, different basic needs can be fulfilled. For arts and crafts, the psyhological needs are fulfilled. Their esteem needs are to be fulfilled because of their ability to create a piece of art. They will be able to follow instructions and be able to work their creative muscle.

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

> Before how-to websites accumulated professionals and contributors to make articles and guides, people would have to learn about projects and skills mostly through their peers. Users might pay for guided instruction to learn new things. Generally, information would be passed through word of mouth or written by hand. If users were looking for convenient ways to do something, it would mostly be through trial and error or even recall. 

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

> Limitations in learning new skills and projects would be the high time and material costs of lessons. The classroom is an excellent way to learn but there are plenty of projects that do not require an entire learning course. There are creative tasks like card making that just needs a few quick instructions. With technology, users may gain inspiration from a digital search and they will be able to pull up the list of required materials and instructions at almost any time. It makes it easier for users to remember and follow along.
> When learning and recalling a project, users may stick to one method. With the various styles in the different how-guides, users will be able to choose what kind of craft project (in this case, a card) they are looking for. 
## **Step 2: Target Users** ##

> **Demographics:** Anyone interested in learning about new skills and projects. People who are more creatively inclined.
> 
> **Preferences:** Users who have the desire to learn and are looking for convenient resources to do so.
> 
> **Expertise:** Users do not need any particular level of expertise for this project.

> The context of use for this project is that users will be able to learn how to make a greeting card. To complete this activity, users will able to follow a set of instructions and a list of materials.

## **Step 3: Pick Research Method(s)** ##

> This project follows observation methods by employing participatory observation. With this, there were activities and questions that the participant explores. This is to get a genuine reaction and opinion to the websites. The interview will most likely be conversation to promote and uphold the goal of candid reactions to best understand from the user's perspective.
> 
> This interview was conducted over Zoom Conference Call to follow COVID-19 protocols. This is reasonable because in terms of accessibility and relevance, if a user were to need to look up a how-to guide, it should be on hand and thus, convenient. 
> The user is asked to share their screen while I recorded the task. 

> *I used a different participant from my usability test for consistency. Some peers are not as technologically inclined so I want to help make helpful websites as easy to access and understand as possible. My participant this time is more technologically inclined so I got to understand the perspective of someone who had a lot of feedback to give.*

## **Notable Moments From The Interview:**

**The Power of Visual Instruction**
> *00:06:44* "I'm not much of a reader. So whichever website that includes like pictures or video that helps me a lot to see cause I like doing things and learning stuff hands-on and being in person. Whereas reading can get a bit difficult and you can see there's a lot of misunderstanding when it tells you to do certain stuff and you do it wrong."
