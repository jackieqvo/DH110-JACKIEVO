# Bridging Generations: The Intersection of Digital Instruction and Tentative Questions

> *The objective of this assignment is to begin detaching myself towards the website(s) I have been analyzing to understand things from the user's perspective. It is important to gain new insight and things that I have not thought of.*
 
## Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype ##
__Digital Humanities 110 | Jacqueline "Jackie" Vo__

## Project Description ##
**What is the purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping?**
> This project is looking to solve user difficulties when searching online for how-to guides in their day-to-day tasks. The target community is anyone looking to self-teach and learn. These users are people who prefer to look for solutions to their projects in an efficient and clear manner. Based on user research from previous assignemnets, the following features are meant to solve the overcomplicated guides that may be found on the internet. 

**Minimalist Design**: To help users not feel so overwhelmed at the search results.
**Recommendation Feature**: Takes into account the category of the search to suggest related articles for more specific guides.
**Informational Section**: Content such as "Tips and Warnings" and "Things You'll Need" are more essential and should be emphasized. If strategically placed, users will be able to feel more confident and/or better gauge their capabilities before pursuing the project. 
**Ratings**: Articles are rated based on their concise and clear instructions. Think of an "upvote" on Reddit.

> Target users value efficiency and clarity when going through their how-to guides. In this project, the prototyping will be for the user's mobile experience with the site. User personas were created based on the premise of each individual's willingness to learn on their own for adequate solutions. While one user persona was a college student looking to maximize his time during remote learning, the other user persona needed to learn on her own so that she wouldn't have to depend on her family. 

> The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test how these features are able to flow and function in this earlier readaptation of this how-to website. These prototypes will help see if the features will work for users in a setting that is not imagined. As the designer, I will again be able to watch how my users navigate and feel about my features. In addition to this, it would be a good opportunity for me to ask if there is something that they feel is lacking from the website/mobile application.
