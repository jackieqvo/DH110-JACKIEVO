# Bridging Generations: The Intersection of Digital Instruction and Tentative Questions
## Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype ##
__Digital Humanities 110 | Jacqueline "Jackie" Vo__

## Project Description ##
**What is the purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping?**
> This project is looking to solve user difficulties when searching online for how-to guides in their day-to-day tasks. The target community is anyone looking to self-teach and learn. These users are people who prefer to look for solutions to their projects in an efficient and clear manner. Based on user research from previous assignemnets, the following features are meant to solve the overcomplicated guides that may be found on the internet. 

* **Minimalist Design**: To help users not feel so overwhelmed at the search results.
* **Recommendation Feature**: Takes into account the category of the search to suggest related articles for more specific guides. This feature will probably me a pull-out tab so it does not distract from the main article. 
* **Informational Section**: Content such as "Tips and Warnings" and "Things You'll Need" are more essential and should be emphasized. If strategically placed, users will be able to feel more confident and/or better gauge their capabilities before pursuing the project. *See next feature*: Users will be able to rate and critique content like materials, warnings, and even tips.
* **Ratings**: Articles are rated based on their concise and clear instructions. Think of an "upvote" on Reddit. With this, users will also be able to rate parts of the article and submit their own comments for improvement.

> Target users value efficiency and clarity when going through their how-to guides. In this project, the prototyping will be for the user's mobile experience with the site. User personas were created based on the premise of each individual's willingness to learn on their own for adequate solutions. While one user persona was a college student looking to maximize his time during remote learning, the other user persona needed to learn on her own so that she wouldn't have to depend on her family. 

> The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test how these features are able to flow and function in this earlier readaptation of this how-to website. These prototypes will help see if the features will work for users in a setting that is not imagined. As the designer, I will again be able to watch how my users navigate and feel about my features. In addition to this, it would be a good opportunity for me to ask if there is something that they feel is lacking from the website/mobile application. 

## Tasks ##
> This low fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
> 1. Searching an article
> 2. Rating an article
> 3. Exploring the categories for the articles
> 4. Filtering articles with users' preferences

## Wireframes and Wireflow (V1 - Before Testing) ##

**Flow Explanation**: The flow is to show what features a user might encounter or look for when searching up how-to articles. There are two main paths that are most relevant to the user. The first one is to go through their intended search and the next one is to explore articles that the site has to offer. For the most relevant flow, the user will click their search and be lead directly to an article. On that page, they will see images, warnings, tips, and so on. The most popular functions on the site should be be here. The article and task is accomplished if the user is fine with leaving the website after. However, if they are unhappy with the content, they are able to submit a rating on any of the sections of the guide. Users are allowed to rate the guide out of five stars, rate their satisfaction with the tips and warnings on a sliding scale, and they have two boxes that are open to any of their critiques and comments. After their submission, they will reach a thank you page and that will give them the option to return to the article or begin a new search.

The second task and pathway is just exploration of the article. If they have no specific search, they can go through the categories of the site and see articles that interest them. This is related ot the "Related Articles" feature so hypotherically speaking, if a user were to go to their standard article, they would find this "Related Articles" feature. From there, they can explore articles within that category. This is all meant to make their learning experience easier and less convoluted. 

**Features Explanation**:
* **Minimalist Design**: The amount of information is overwhelming so the site has pull out tabs and "Read More" features. Users are able to get more content at their own discretion. Something else that is included to keep a minimalist feel is the faded texts. There are details here and there with lower opacity rates so that the eyes know where to focus on. When users click on the pull-out box of related articles, the article behind them fades slightly. 
* **Recommendation Feature**: The recommendation feature is on almost every page in the header. The "Explore" tab is always there because even if users come with a goal in mind, the option to learn more is still there. 
* **Informational Section/Ratings**: On top of allowing users to submit critiques and comments about the articles, users are also able to rate the articles. From the materials to their tips and warnings, this feature is meant to give the users more control. This is projected to help the article be more helpful for others. In addition to this, the ratings data can be used to help sort related articles and filter out articles by the user's preferences.
