# Bridging Generations: The Intersection of Digital Instruction and Tentative Questions
## Assignment 06: High Fidelity Prototype ##
__Digital Humanities 110 | Jacqueline "Jackie" Vo__

## Project Description, Process, and Purpose ##
**Project Description**
> This project is looking to solve user difficulties when searching online for how-to guides in their day-to-day tasks. The target community is anyone looking to self-teach and learn. These users are people who prefer to look for solutions to their projects in an efficient and clear manner. Based on user research from previous assignments, the following features are meant to solve the overcomplicated guides that may be found on the internet. 

**What is the purpose of this high-fidelity prototyping?**
> The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to make the low-fidelity protoype functional. Through user-centered review and improvements, the high-fidelity prototype will be something that users can physically test. This rendition of wikiHow will better organize common tasks that the two developed user personas will need. While one is more goal-oriented and looking to find articles in an efficient manner, the other user persona is looking to explore the application. With these two types of users in mind, the mobile application will ideally be troubleshooting details to make the information less overwhelming to take in.

**What is the process?**
> The interactions and observations made during usability testing and contextual analysis are all included in the making of this prototype. Once user personas were made, wireframes and wireflows were made in the low-fidelity prototype assignment. Based on the feedback from the users that tested that, another low-fidelity prototype was made. From there, those changes were incorporated into this high-fidelity prototype. This interactive prototype was created using Figma with a ideas derived from the wikiHow website. 

## Prototype Tasks ##
This low fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:

* Searching an article.
* Rating an article.
* Exploring the categories for the articles.
* Filtering articles with users' preferences.\

## Screen Design (With Color Variations)  ##
Variations include light-mode, hue variation, dark-mode, and black-out mode.
